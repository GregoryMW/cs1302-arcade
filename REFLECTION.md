## SUN 2019-04-05 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code.

2. **TODO:** Finish reading the project description.

3. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but now that we've settled on a regular day/time things are looking
   great!

## TUE 2019-04-16 @ 5:30 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Created a main menu containing buttons for the two games, Space Invaders and 2048.
    also created the skeletons for two classes, each representing their respective games. Also
    gave buttons an image as well as adding a background to main menu.

2. **TODO:** Begin work on creating Space Invaders. We plan on creating a 2d-array in which the
    aliens will move across according to the rules of the game.

3. **PROB:** Deciding how to display the game, using multiple imageviews in each array space, or
    some other way.

## TUE 2019-04-23 @ 11:00 AM EST

1. **DONE:** Began work on the Space Invaders game. Created the images for the aliens as well
    as the ship, made the ship able to be moved by the left and right arrow keys and the aliens
    move every two seconds.

2. **TODO:** Add bounds to the aliens so that they move down a row at the edge of the screen,
    then move in the other direction. Also need to start work on the 2048 game as well.

3. **PROB:** Keeping track of where the last alien in a row is and using that to check the bounds
    is a bit tricky due to the way the images are stored. May have to rework the way images are placed
    in the scene.

## TUE 2019-04-30 @ 7:00 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Completed most of the work on the Space Invaders game. ALien movement, bullet mechanics,
    as well as collision detection and ship movement.

2. **TODO:** Implement shooting aliens, scoreboard, and difficulty increase upon completeion of a level.
    Also need to fix alien movement a bit. Also need to begin work on 2048 game.

3. **PROB:** Had issues with git not moving the master branch with the HEAD branch. Not much with the
    game itself.

## MON 2019-05-06 5:00 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Completed the arcade application :)

2. **TODO:** Submit the project.

3. **PROB:** In the end, nothing too serious enough to give us a difficult time.
