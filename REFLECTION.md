1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code.

2. **TODO:** Finish reading the project description.

3. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but now that we've settled on a regular day/time things are looking
   great!

## TUE 2019-04-16 @ 5:30 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Created a main menu containing buttons for the two games, Space Invaders and 2048.
    also created the skeletons for two classes, each representing their respective games. Also
    gave buttons an image as well as adding a background to main menu.

2. **TODO:** Begin work on creating Space Invaders. We plan on creating a 2d-array in which the
    aliens will move across according to the rules of the game.

3. **PROB:** Deciding how to display the game, using multiple imageviews in each array space, or
    some other way.
